The Kinesis Shard Calculator recommends the *optimal number of shards for a Kinesis data stream*, and shows the corresponding *cost estimation*. It also provides recommendations for improving the efficiency and lower the cost of the data stream.

An explanation for the various input attributes and results are provided within the Kinesis Shard Calculator. It should be pretty straight-forward. If not, please do provide feedback on our github project!

The background reasoning for the calculation of shards is going to be the topic of a [presentation at AWS re:Invent 2018](https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=90058). The video of the presentation as well as the slides will be available a few days later.
